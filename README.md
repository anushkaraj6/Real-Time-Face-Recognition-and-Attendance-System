# Real-Time-Face-Recognition-and-Attendance-System

The general statement of the face recognition issue (in computer vision) is using a stored database of faces, recognise or verify one or more people in a scene provided still or video images.
Facial recognition is usually divided into two stages:
-	Face Detection - It is a technique that involves searching a picture for a face, then processing the image to crop and isolate the person's face for easier identification.
-	Face Recognition - It is the process of comparing a detected and processed face to a database of known faces to determine who that individual is.
